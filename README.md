Briefly summarize The Gaming Room client and their software requirements. Who was the client? What type of software did they want you to design?

The Gaming Room is a client that previously had success with a riddle game on Android and wanted to create an online version of it to be accessible across multiple platforms and devices. For instance, by writing out a detailed suggestion document covering various important areas like the host operating system, memory and storage management on servers, the API framework, security, and the benefits of using serverless architecture.

What did you do particularly well in developing this documentation?

I think I did well by revising my previous work on each assignment to develop a better result in the end, which in-turn helps me to write this journal with that data and information with detailed suggestion segment outlining important areas for the client's consideration to create a strong case for why a cloud platform would be the best choice for the client's needs and goals. 

What about the process of working through a design document did you find helpful when developing the code? If you could choose one part of your work on these documents to revise, what would you pick? How would you improve it?


The section that looked at popular operating systems like Mac, Windows, and Linux could be improved by diving deeper into the differences between these platforms on the client side, especially since the main concern for the client-side is the web browser. I could have explored how different operating systems favor certain browsers, which could affect the application's performance and user experience.

How did you interpret the user’s needs and implement them into your software design? Why is it so important to consider the user’s needs when designing?

The main thing to remember when developing web applications is that speed and ease of use are crucial. Users might tolerate a less attractive interface, but they won't stick around if the functionality is confusing or slow. Understanding the client's needs is vital because they represent the primary source of revenue.

How did you approach designing software? What techniques or strategies would you use in the future to analyze and design a similar software application?

When it comes to programming, I would start with broad goals and work my way to specific solutions by categorizing that needs to be completed, small and big tasks. I could do this by breaking down high-level business objectives into functional requirements, then into technical requirements, and finally into design documents, architecture, and code that meet those requirements. This structured approach ensures that the final product meets the client's needs and goals effectively.
